# Platform utilities

[简体中文](PLATFORM_UTILITIES.zh-CN.md)

Common operations have direct C entry points. Optional C++11 headers wrap the
same implementation. A NULL context selects the existing immutable default
allocator. Feature switches retain declarations and failure stubs, with the
corresponding capability bit cleared.

## System information

`hx_os_sysinfo.h` provides byte counts, CPU topology, page size, filesystem
space, current-process memory and OS version. `HX_OS_ENABLE_SYSINFO` defaults
to ON. Library version and ABI queries remain available with it disabled.
These calls do not create workers, install handlers or alter process state.

```c
hx_string version = HX_STRING_INIT;
hx_os_error error;
hx_os_status status = hx_os_sys_version_string(&version, &error);
/* Check status, then use hx_string_c_str(&version). */
hx_string_destroy(&version);
```

For versioned disk/process result structs, use their `*_INFO_INIT` macros.
Buffer-based text queries report the required capacity including NUL. Scalar
and structured outputs retain their prior values on failure.

CPU counts describe online system CPUs, across Windows processor groups, not
the current process affinity mask or a cgroup CPU quota. Linux physical counts
deduplicate online package/core pairs in sysfs; unavailable topology is
NOT_SUPPORTED, never a logical-core count presented as physical cores.

Available RAM is Windows available physical memory, Linux `MemAvailable`, or
macOS free plus inactive pages. The macOS value is an estimate, and these
snapshots do not promise that a subsequent allocation succeeds. Linux queries
describe the OS view, not a container-specific memory limit. Disk available
space uses POSIX `f_bavail`, distinct from total free blocks `f_bfree`.

Current-process resident bytes are the working set/RSS. Virtual bytes describe
reserved plus committed virtual address space on Windows, `/proc/self/statm`
size on Linux, and Mach virtual size on macOS; they are not commit charge or
physical memory consumption. Native resource queries can block.

`hx_os_cpu_usage_create` takes an initial process CPU and monotonic sample.
Each successful query returns the interval average since the previous sample:
`100 * process_cpu_delta / elapsed_delta / initial_logical_cpu_count`.
Children are excluded. Callers serialize access to each sampler; samplers are
independent and allocate through their context. A zero-length interval returns
WOULD_BLOCK without advancing the sample. OS counter granularity and changes
in CPU topology can affect short samples. The sampler does not clamp results.

```cpp
#include <hx/SystemInfo.hpp>
auto version = hx::SystemInfo::version();
auto space = hx::SystemInfo::diskSpace(".");
hx::CpuUsage cpu;
/* Do work or wait before sampling. */
double percent = cpu.query();
```

C++ convenience methods throw the existing `hx::StatusError`, including its
native error fields. `CpuUsage` owns its sampler and supports moves. These
headers need C++11; the underlying library remains C99. The standalone C
example is `examples/system_info.c`.
